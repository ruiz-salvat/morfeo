# Morfeo

* In this repository you will find a proof of concept of a stock trading bot developed in Python.

* The main application can be found at the Bot folder. It is a REST API which uses Flask and stores data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). It is a multithreading application which implements some design patterns such as the service pattern or the observable pattern. Some tests are included as well.

* A basic front-end based in the Angular framework can be found at the Web folder.

* Note that the project is still being developed and no user authentication is implemented yet.

* In the data folder there is some mock data used to test the bot.

* At the Docs folder there is some documentation and diagrams. However, some of the documentation is obsolete and most of it still needs to be done.

* In the Analysis folder there are some experiments done with Jupyter notebook.

* The Archive folder contains some obsolete projects which have been replaced. Better ignore that folder.
